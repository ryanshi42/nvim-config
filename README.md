# ðŸ’¤ ryanshi42 Neovim Config

My Neovim config largely uses the LazyVim template which I used below. My plugin manager is vim-plug, and I haven't really had any bad issues with it thus far though I have seen a lot of other people use Packer, of which the syntax might be a little more intuitive. The plugged folder contains the plugins which are autoloaded upon Vim entry.

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
